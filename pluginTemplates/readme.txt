If you want to implement a new plugin, copy the content of
the corresponding folder into your plugin source repository
and adjust the filenames and the content of the files.

The CMakeLists.txt file contains lot of documentation in order
to help to modify it. In the source files also replace the
names of the classes by a suitable name, e.g. replace the
string MyGrabber or AlgoPlugin.
