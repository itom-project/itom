This chapter contains documents that should be read and considered if one wants to contribute to itom or one
of its plugins. It mainly consists of descriptions of different style guides, that are used within the itom project
to provide a common code representation, as well as an introduction to translations of itom or its plugins.

.. note:
    
    This document will be extended in the future.
