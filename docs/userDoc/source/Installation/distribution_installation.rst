Installation using the setup.exe
=================================

For your convenience you can download an installer package from **\\\\Obelix\\software\\m\\ITOM\\Setup**. 

After the installation you should copy the folders **lib** and **plugins** in the installation directory for having the standard plugins available.

In the course of the setup, the following parts will be installed along with |itom|:

1. Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Runtime Libraries (x86)
2. Python 3.2.1
3. numpy
4. ScyPy

In the following we will guide you through the installation setup with a couple of screenshots (German system):
