Getting the programm
**********************

There are two ways of getting |itom| on your computer. 

The first one is using the installer :doc:`setup.exe <distribution_installation>` to install the current release version of iTOM with precompiled plugIns on your computer.

The second way is to get the source files and build your own |itom| -exe. This way is more complicated. You need to install :doc:`the development environment <environment_installation>`, including visual studio or QtCreator. With this installation, you can change the C/C++ code of |itom| and develop your own plugIns.

For beginners and persons who only want to use python-scripts and simple GUI-interaktion we recommend the easy setup.exe installation.

For developers we recommend the installation of the |itom| developement enviorment.
