| The Plugin toolbox shows every loaded plugin. There are 3 different types: motor, algo and IO plugins (grabber, raw IO).
| Double-Clicking on a Plugin unfolds it and the number of opened instances is shown.

All plugin DLLs in the plugin folder are loaded at the start. Therefore new plugins have to be compiled first. The source files of every plugin are saved in the *pluginSource* folder and the compiled files in the *plugin* folder.
