figures and basic plots
=========================

itom contains functions for direct plotting of dataObjects, point cloud structures and npArrays.


To allow the user to adapted and expand this functionality or include the plots into more complex user interfaces,
the plots sourced into QT-DesignerPlugins, loaded as libraries during itom-startup.
