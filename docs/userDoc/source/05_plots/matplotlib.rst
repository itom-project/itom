Matplotlib
****************

itom is not only able to plot array-like structures like :py:class:`itom.dataObject` or Numpy arrays but it also provides a designer plugin widget
that can be used to render the output of the famous Python package **Matplotlib** into a plot window. It is even possible to integrate this type of
widget, like all other designer plugins as well, into an user-defined graphical user interface.

For more information about the Matplotlib functionality, see this :ref:`this section <pymod-matplotlib>`.
