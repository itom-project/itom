isometric Plot
****************

"itom1DQWTFigure" is a plot for pseudo 3D visualization of image like DataObjects. It is based on openGL and renders the objects
either to triangles ("triangle mode") or points ("Joe-Mode").
All DataTypes are accepted. To plot complex objects, it is possible to select between the following modes: "absolut", "phase", "real" and "imaginary".

The line plot offers two point pickers, addressed by "Key 1" and "Key 2". Picker_2 is allways on the right side of Picker_1. The are moved by "Key Left" and "Key Right" or by pressing the left mouse key.
