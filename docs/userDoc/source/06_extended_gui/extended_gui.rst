Extending the user interface of |itom|
###########################################

|itom| provides various possibilities to modify and extend the user interface. This chapter
gives introductions to these features. Besides showing messages and input boxes, you can
use specific script commands to add new toolbars or menus to the main window of |itom|. Additionally
it is possible to design user defined dialog and windows by using the WYSIWYG Qt designer or even
implement complex GUIs with dependencies to other 3rd party libraries within a plugin.
