Draw pickers 1D plot
=======================


This demo shows how to programatically set pickers
to the line of a 1D plot.

The most important ``slots`` for these features are implemented
in the designer widget ``itom1dqwtplot``:

.. code-block:: python

    myPlotHandle.call("setPicker", axis-values [, curveIndex = 0, physicalCoordinates=True])
    myPlotHandle.call("appendPicker", axis-values [, curveIndex = 0, physicalCoordinates=True])
    myPlotHandle.call("deletePicker", [index])

``setPicker`` and ``appendPicker`` are used to set a new set of pickers or append further
pickers to the existing set of pickers. ``deletePicker`` is used to clear existing pickers.

For settings pickers, a list or tuple of axis-values has to be given. The corresponding value
is calculated based on the current curve, that is displayed. In order to stick the new picker
to another than the first curve, use another ``curveIndex`` parameter. Usually, the axis-values
are considered to be given in physical coordinates (which are displayed in the coordinate system).

If you want to give the coordinate of a picker in real pixel-coordinates of the ``dataObject``,
set ``physicalCoordinates`` to False.
