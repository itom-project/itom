Breakpoints

In the breakpoints Toolbox all breakpoints of current functions are listed. It gives an overview of all breakpoints even of functions which are not currently opened in the editor.

For a normal run of the iTOM software the breakpoint toolbox is not neccessary, its only useful during :doc:`debugging <../script-language/debugging>` of some scripts or functions.
