Get sources from Git
==========================

The core of |itom|, some plugins as well as designer-plugins are hosted in different Git-repositories on *bitbucket.org*. 

.. note::
GIT is a distributed version and source code management system, that allows several developers to work on the same source code simultaneously. |itom| is hosted under GIT
at bitbucket.org. 

The different parts can be found at the following resources:

In order to get the sources you want, clone the specific repository to a source-folder on your computer. If you want to receive data by *ssh*, you need your own
account on *bitbucket.org*, where you public *ssh* has been set under your personal settings.
