 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * The main purpose for the QPropertyEditor is the visualization and manipulation of properties defined via the Q_PROPERTY macro in
 * QObject based classes.
 */

/**
 * \brief The QPropertyEditorWidget offers an easy to use mechanism to visualize properties of a class inherited from QObject.
 *
 * Qt provides a nice way to define class properties by using the Q_PROPERTY macro. The purpose of the QPropertyEditor
 * is to visualize these properties in an easy way.
 *
 * To use the property editor, all you have to do is to create a class that defines it's properties by using Q_PROPERTY
 * and to add this class by using the addObject() method of this QPropertyEditorWidget class.
 * The QPropertyEditorWidget is inherited from QTreeView and will display the properties in a tree with two columns: Name and Value
 *
 * For basic data types the build in editor widgets of Qt will be used. The QPropertyEditor itself only defines an additional
 * editor for QColor (based on the Color Editor Factory Example from Trolltech). But it can easily be extended by yourself
 * either within the library or for special datatypes also outside of the library in your application.
