# itom #

welcome to the open source software **itom**. It allows operating measurement systems with multiple hardware components, like cameras, AD-converters, actuators, motor stages as well as handling your lab automation. The graphical user interface provides a quick and easy access to all components, complex measurement tasks and algorithms can be scripted using the embedded python scripting language and self-defined user interfaces finally provide a possibility to adapt **itom** to your special needs. External hardware or algorithms are added to **itom** by an integrated plugin system.

In order to learn more about **itom**, see the official homepage [itom.bitbucket.io](http://itom.bitbucket.io) or read the [user documentation](http://itom.bitbucket.io/latest/docs/)

### What is this repository for? ###
