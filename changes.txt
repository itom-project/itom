8d1d3846 Merged itom/itom/remove_qt4 into remove_qt4
4b217b2d macro 'itom_fetch_git_commit_hash' added to ItomBuildMacros.cmake to get the current Git commit hash and store it in a gitVersion.h file in the file gitVersion.h in the project's output folder (can be changed). This behaviour can be toggled by the BUILD_GIT_TAG flag in CMake. This can only be done if the Git package can be found by CMake.
970aba08 removed SET_PROPERTY(CACHE CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE PROPERTY STRINGS "Debug;Release") from itom CMakeLists.txt, since it raises an error if CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is not defined yet. An improved solution will be given in the removeQt4 branch (soon).
14c1c4b8 improved handling of setting a CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE to a reasonable default value if not yet set. This also checks for the existence of CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES. CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES is set to reasonable values, too, if not yet defined.
2db41da5 FindITOM_SDK.cmake adapted: BUILD_TARGET64 will now be forced to the value, set in itom_sdk.cmake of itom's SDK. Additionally, all possibly relevant pathes to 3rd party libraries, that are known to the itom project (including its subdirectories) will be read from the itom CMakeCache by the plugins and designerplugins. If the corresponding CMake variables are not yet set and the read values from the cache are valid and the pathes exist on the file system, they are copied to the current plugin or designerplugin repository (during the find_package(ITOM_SDK) step).
9e267cc6 CMake cleanup: removed more unused lines in the CMakeLists.txt file (e.g. due to the Qt4 removal or improvements of the OpenCV include for CMake >= 3.0). More improvements in ItomBuildMacros. FindITOM_SDK adapted to new SDK structure.
48025482 *.cmake files moved to cmake subfolder and will also be added to cmake subfolder of SDK * MSVC only: compile_debug/release.bat files moved to msvc folder and simplified by configure_file in CMake generation * itom will always be built in UNICODE now (CMake option removed) * all itom libraries will always be built as SHARED libraries (CMake option removed) * cleanup in many CMake files of itom core solution
