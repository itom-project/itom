This project is licensed under the LGPLv2 version.

The comments of the website above mentions, that there was a license discrepancy between 
the license stated at the website and information, contained in some header files.

A reader 'jacmoe' has written that he proposes the following license information:

// *************************************************************************************************

The creator of the library ('Volki') responded to this proposal with 'LGPL is fine'.
Therefore the itom developers assume that the LGPL license, as stated above, is correct for this library.
