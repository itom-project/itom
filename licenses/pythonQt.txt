PythonQt
---------------------------

The core application of itom provides dynamic bindings from Python to signals, slots
and properties of classes that are derived from QObject (see Qt Framework).
This binding mechanism is inspired by the PythonQt project, which is licensed under LGPLv2.1.

For sources and further information of the PythonQt project see 
https://mevislab.github.io/pythonqt or https://github.com/MeVisLab/pythonqt.

itom uses only the basic idea from PythonQt. Therefore nothing is used from the generators, 
that are contained in PythonQt. No generators are used and shipped with itom.

License information from PythonQt
----------------------------------

PythonQt is distributed under the LGPL 2.1 license. It can be used in commercial applications when 
following the LGPL 2.1 obligations.

Licensing of Generator (part of the original license information of PythonQt, however not used in itom)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build system of PythonQt makes use of a patched version of the LGPL'ed QtScript generator, 
located in the generator directory. See the LICENSE.LPGL file in the generator subdirectory for 
details. Copyright (C) 2009 Nokia Corporation and/or its subsidiary(-ies)

See https://code.qt.io/cgit/qt-labs/qtscriptgenerator.git for the original project. The PythonQt 
wrappers generated by the generator are distributed under the LGPL as well. The generated wrappers 
are pre-generated and checked-in, so you only need to build and run the generator when you want to 
build additional wrappers or you want to upgrade/downgrade to another Qt version, but this requires 
updating the typesystems as well.
