I found a solution for this. At least it worked for me (win 7 x64).



First, open Notepad and paste the below code:



taskkill /F /IM explorer.exe
cd /d %userprofile%\AppData\Local
attrib –h IconCache.db
del IconCache.db
start explorer

save the file as a .bat file on your desktop.
Then open explorer and navigate to C:\users\username\appdata\local\ (make sure you've select to view hidden folders) and delete IconCache.db.



Lastly, double click on the .bat file that you saved on your desktop and all icons should be restored.
